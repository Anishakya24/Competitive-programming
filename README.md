# Competitive Programming Challenges

Welcome to the **Competitive Programming Challenges** repository! ðŸš€  
This repository contains solutions to various competitive programming problems that I have solved from different platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, **Codeforces**, **Coding Ninjas**, and more.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- Each problem is stored in a separate directory.
- The directory name follows the pattern: `Competitive-programing`.
- Each problem includes a detailed description, the problem statement, and the solution code.
- Solutions are written in **C++**, or any other languages I use during my problem-solving journey.
